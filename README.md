# README

Run 'npm install' once you have forked and cloned the repo.
Run 'node server.js' to start the server.
Run 'npm run dev -- --watch' to allow webpack to watch the files and build the bundle.js files.

Open your browser and open local host with the corresponding port number located in the server.js file.

BUGS/To fix:

Exercise 1 has an issue in which multiple submits are needed on certain numbers.
Exercise 1 required an onBlur event to reset the binary plateu after each submit, time constraints prevented me from dealing with this.

Exercise 2 has a bug when week or day is selected during an event. Again, time restrains prevented me from fully understanding the react calendar library used.
Exercise 2 displays undefined when an event is clicked.

Notes:

I did not have long to complete the task unfortunately. I really do appreciate the opportunity and would love any feedback on my work, I would like to develop this project further. Thanks again!
